/// The assignment operator (=) is being used to assign
/// `pi` (a variable) a value of 3.14 (an expression).
/// The assigned value does not have to be a literal. It
/// can also be a value that is returned via a function
/// call. For example: `let json: String = networkCall()`
/// where `networkCall` has a signature of `networkCall()
/// -> String`.
